lua port of 
(a) the cl.hpp file
(b) my CLCommon code

I'm going to create wrapper classes (just like I do with my 'gl' project)
But should I put them in the 'cl' directly, and the cl.hpp equivalent functions elsewhere?
or should I put them elsewhere and leave cl.hpp here?  This for now.  I'll put the wrapper classes in the obj folder.

uses luajit ffi and my lua-ext project.

The obj/ wrapper classes make use of my lua-template project.
